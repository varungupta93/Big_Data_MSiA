Hourly:
Crimes are with arrests clearly maximum in the nighttime hours when people are still likely to be outside.
It's likely that with fewer people out late in the night, there's less opportunity for crime.
We also see that there's more crime around lunchtime, again possibly due to people being out before returning home/ to work.

Day of Week:
It's difficult to explain, but the most crime occurs on weekdays from Tuesday-Friday but not Monday.
The biggest drop is on Sunday.

This could be explained by there being more people out and commuting on weekdays than especially Sunday.
Also Monday being the first day of the week perhaps people tend to go straight home typically.
It's also possible that police staffing is less on Sundays, and maybe even Mondays, resulting in fewer arrests.

Month of Year:
While we know that crime itself occurs more frequently in the warm summer months, arrests are fairly stable.
This means that a number of criminals in the summer likely go uncaught, perhaps demonstrating a need for increased police presence.
While January is a relatively low crime month, there's a large number of arrests, which could maybe be attributed to a post Christmas show of strength for the new year, and increased law-enforcement motivation.
