Exercise 2:

We see the top emojis are for pizza and beer, which seems appropriate.

We do see that on Tuesday and Wednesday, pizza is no longer the most common emoji, perhaps with people  neither too miserable like on Monday nor too happy.
As one would expect, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, beers are more commonly used (2nd highest), with many other drinks emojis as well.



When performing clustering, the features used were:
Number of emojis, #utility emojis, #food emojis, # of characters, # of words, length of largest word.

After normalizing data, and testing on 2-6 cluster solutions, the 5 cluster solution was found to be optimal.

The 5 cluster solution gives us the following cluster profiles:
Cluster 1- low on emojis, high on words and characters
Cluster 2- About average on emojis of all forms, low on other characters
Cluster 3- Above average on words and characters - verbose, more likely to use food emoji than utility
Cluster 4- Extremely above average on emojis - almost spam. All food. Perhaps excited people post dinner.
Cluster 5- Plenty of emojis again, more likely to be utility emojis than food though.
